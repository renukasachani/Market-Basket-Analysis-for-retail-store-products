# Dissertation : Market-Basket-Analysis-for-retail-store-products

 ‘Market basket analysis’ is a well-known data mining method used for finding the relations among various products 
 in the customers' shopping cart. The primary aim of this research thesis is to observe the important factors that 
 affect the sales of items in the retail store and based on those factors the research study aims to understand the 
 consumers' behaviour. Therfore, consumers will get an idea about the potential future customers who are likely to 
 come back for shopping. 
 
 Knowing, such type of information, retailers can use this research for making powerful business decisions about 
 inventory management, cross-selling items and arranging the shelf layout. 
 
 Six machine learning algorithms based on the two-core metrics: classification accuracy and classification report 
 were applied to compare and contrast the results obtained.
